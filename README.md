## Example of parameterized reports in Rmarkdown


So, I was taking a class on Rmarkdowm. I had to teach parameterized reports using Rmarkdown (It is amazing, I thought the learners will greatly benefit). At this point the learners had successfully learned about basics of dplyr, ggplot2 and writing functions in R and purrr.

__BUT__, I goofed up while giving the demo. The file I made before had decided to embarrass me. So I made one on the go, it worked fine but I was not able to do such a great job explaining the process. With this repo I plan to do this. I shall also put up a screen recorded video along with the code in this repo.

_Look up the ex_para.Rmd and script_run_all_analysis_


### A little about the data

The data I am using is the data from Census Village Directory for the sate of Gujarat. I have cleaned the column names beforehand.

### The videos

The [link to video](https://youtu.be/UvrldLbsfdM) for how to write parameterised reports. The screen recorder did not anything other than my RStudio, so some parts look weird. But the generated files are uploaded on the repo for reference.
