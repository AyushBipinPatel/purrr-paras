## Example of parameterized reports in Rmarkdown


So, I was taking a class on Rmarkdowm. I had to teach parameterized reports using Rmarkdown (It is amazing, I thought the learners will greatly benefit). At this point the learners had successfully learned about basics of dplyr, ggplot2 and writing functions in R and purrr.

__BUT__, I goofed up while giving the demo. The file I made before had decided to embarrass me. So I made one on the go, it worked fine but I was not able to do such a great job explaining the process. With this repo I plan to do this. I shall also put up a screen recorded video along with the code in this repo.
